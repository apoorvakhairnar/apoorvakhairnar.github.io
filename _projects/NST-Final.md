Biology has traditionally been inspiring the field of robotics and aiding the development of ever-more capable robots. However, the incorporation of such flexible motions in rigid-bodied robots is a challenging and costly endeavor. This challenge has driven the necessity for soft robots capable of exhibiting complex, flexible maneuvers while adapting to their surroundings. However, the modeling and control of these robots poses substantial challenges compared to their rigid counterparts. Thus, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of a Lyapunov-based nonlinear control technique across various selected models of a soft robot. As Sliding Mode Control (SMC) is well-known for its robustness against uncertainties and adaptability to highly nonlinear systems, this paper focuses on the various implementations of SMC for the control of soft robot models such as the Piecewise Constant Curvature and the Cosserat Rod Theory. Additionally, this paper also focuses on two distinctive applications of SMC for robot-specific dynamic models. Further, it comprehensively compares the merits, drawbacks, and key features of these algorithms while highlighting the future scope of control technologies in soft robotic systems.
