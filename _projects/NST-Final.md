As a part of the final evaluation of the Nonlinear Systems Theory course offered at <a href="https://vt.edu">Virginia Tech</a> (VT), a survey of Sliding Mode Control technique
for soft robots was conducted. This project was conducted under the guidance of 
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yRvv6IgAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Craig Woolsey</a> from the Department of Aerospace and Ocean Engineering at VT.

The goal was to review existing Lyapunov-based nonlinear contorl techniques for soft robots and since Sliding Mode Control is well-known for its robustness against uncertainties
and adaptability  to highly nonlinear systems, this project focused on various implementations of SMC for control of soft robots. Piecewise Constant Curvature and 
Cosserat Rod models were some of the models used in these SMC implementations. The project also included two robot-specific dynamic models for osft robots. The paper
comprehensively compared the merits, drawbacks, and key features of these algorithms while highlighting the future scopt of control techniques for soft robots.

The survey paper will be uploaded on ResearchGate shortly.
