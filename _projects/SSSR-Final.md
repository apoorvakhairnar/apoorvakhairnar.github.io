        <h1>Kirigami Vacuum Jamming Gripper</h1>
        <p>
            This project was conducted as a part of the Soft Robotics course (Special Study) offered at <a href="https://vt.edu">Virginia Tech</a> (VT). It was carried out in a team of 
            6, under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hu-rElUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Dr. Suyi Li</a> from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at VT. 
            The goal of this project was to design and fabricate an innovative soft robotic gripper that would successfully pick-up the all of the objects from a list 
            specified during the beginning of the course.<br>
            Our team - Robot Revolutionaries came up with the idea of combining the principles of Kirigami and Vacuum Jamming to obtain a unique soft robotic gripper. This gripper 
            would combine the flexibility and dexterity of Kirigami and the variable stiffness and sturdiness of Vacuum Jamming. The gripper was fabricated by cutting out a regular 
            Kirigami gripper from a Kirigami sheet followed by attaching two air-tight pouches of coffee beans for vacuum jamming. Our unique gripper was able to grip objects as light 
            as a paper crane to a filled soda can. Further, it was able to pick-up objects like chicken egg, raspberry, magnets stuck to a metal table, etc. It was a hand-operated 
            gripper that was able to pick-up all objects except a mystery object.<br>
            A detailed report about our gripper can be found <a href="https://sites.google.com/vt.edu/robot-revolutionaries/home">here</a>.
