            <h1>Analysis and Synthesis of Four bar mechanism - Watt's linkage</h1>
            <p>
                As part of the final examination of the elective Analysis and Synthesis of Mechanisms (ASM) offered by the Department of Mechanical Engineering at 
                <a href="https://www.coep.org.in/">COEP-Tech</a>, team 4 analyzed a Four-bar mechanism called the Watt's Linkage. This project was carried out under the guidance of
                <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=u4zim9MAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. A. D. Patange</a> and using the principles of ASM, we synthesized the Watt's linkage using the graphical method. We used Freudenstein's method for analyzing the 
                mechanism, followed by some improvements and verification using the velocity and acceleration diagrams.<br>
                The goal of this project also included the fabrication of the respective mechanism. However, the restrictions imposed after COVID-19 made it difficult to fabricate
                this mechanism using sophisticated manufacturing methods. Nonetheless, we fabricated this mechanism using cardboard and styrofoam, easily available at home 
                during the lockdown.<br>
                A video presentation of this project can be watched on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUdsoSe_8G8&t=9s">YouTube</a> with a detailed report available
