        <h1>The Rising Role of Artificial Intelligence in Inventory Management</h1>
        <p>
            This project was conducted as part of the 6th semester evaluation during my undergraduate studies at <a href="https://www.coep.org.in/">COEP-Tech</a> in a team of 3,
            under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=fvFhvSEAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. N. K. Chougule</a>. The goal of this project was to develop an 
            inventory management system for grocery stores using Machine Learning (ML) and Mechanical Engineering (ME) principles. The project was divided into two parts - 
            software and hardware.<br>
            The software part consisted of developing an ML algorithm for the identification and sorting of grocery items while loading the inventory of a store. We developed a
            Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that was trained to identify the grocery items using the images captured from a smartphone camera. Further, a Graphical User 
            Interface (GUI) was developed to interact with this framework. This GUI was paired with an SQL database of the inventory which would be updated with the loading and
            unloading of goods to and from the store, respectively.<br>
            The proposed hardware for this project consisted of a conveyor belt that would carry objects to the Object identification platform and then load them into the inventory 
            based on the output of the CNN framework. However, due to COVID-19 restrictions and lockdown it was difficult to develop this kind of hardware.<br>
            This project was published in the Autodesk AU 2020 Conference and can be found <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/article/Rising-Role-Artificial-Intelligence-Inventory-Management-2020">here</a>.<br>
            A detailed project report along with the code can be obtained from <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357554750_The_Rising_Role_of_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Inventory_Management">here</a>.
