            <h1>Nonlinear Tracknig Control of 4-DOF Kinova arm using 3 Algorithms</h1>
            <p>
                As a part of the final evaluation of the Robotics and Automation course offered at <a href="https://vt.edu">Virginia Tech</a> (VT), three control algorithms were applied 
                for trajectory tracking of a Kinova arm with 4 Degrees of Freedom (DOF). This project was conducted under the guidance of 
                <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aOboTjAAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Kaveh Akbari Hamed</a> from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at VT.<br>
                A 4-DOF Kinova arm was considered and its equations of motion were obtained using kinematic and dynamic analyses. A desired trajectory was generated using the given
                initial and final joint positions and the Bezier Polynomial equations. This was followed by the application 3 nonlinear controllers - Lyapunov-based controller, 
                Adaptive Lyapunov-based controller and Impedance controller. These controllers were manually tuned and were able successfully track the desired trajectories.<br>
                All the computations and control algorithms were performed in MATLAB followed by the generation of an animation sequence for each of the 3 cases.
