        <h1>Measuring the Circumference of the Earth</h1>
        <p>
            As a high-school sophomore (10th standard) I participated in the Google Science Fair of May 2015, wherein I conducted the project of measuring the circumference 
            of the Earth. Basic trigonometric principles were used for calculating the Sun angle cast at two different locations in India - Pune and Nasik. The difference between 
            these angles and the Norht-South distance between the two cities was used for calculating the circumference of the Earth. Although there was a -0.1% (70km) error in my 
            measurement, I thoroughly enjoyed learning about this method and performing this experiment.
