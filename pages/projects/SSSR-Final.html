            <h1>Kirigami Vacuum Jamming Gripper</h1>
            <p>
                This project was conducted as a part of the Soft Robotics course (Special Study) offered at <a href="https://vt.edu">Virginia Tech</a> (VT). It was carried out in a team of 
                6, under the guidance of Dr. Suyi Li from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at VT. The goal of this project was to design and fabricate an innovative soft robotic 
                gripper that would successfully pick-up the all of the objects from a list specified during the beginning of the course.<br>
                Our team - Robot Revolutionaries came up with the idea of combining the principles of Kirigami and Vacuum Jamming to obtain a unique soft robotic gripper. This gripper 
                would combine the flexibility and dexterity of Kirigami and the variable stiffness and sturdiness of Vacuum Jamming. The gripper was fabricated by cutting out a regular 
                Kirigami gripper from a Kirigami sheet followed by attaching two air-tight pouches of coffee beans for vacuum jamming. Our unique gripper was able to grip objects as light 
                as a paper crane to a filled soda can. Further, it was able to pick-up objects like chicken egg, raspberry, magnets stuck to a metal table, etc. It was a hand-operated 
                gripper that was able to pick-up all objects except a mystery object.<br>
                A detailed report about our gripper can be found <a href="https://sites.google.com/vt.edu/robot-revolutionaries/home">here</a>.
