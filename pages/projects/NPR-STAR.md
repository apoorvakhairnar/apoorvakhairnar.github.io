        <h1>Non-Pyrotechnic Recovery System for High-Powered Rockets</h1>
        <p>
            This project was conducted as a part of the Virtual Training and Internship Programme (VTIP-16) organized by Space Technology and Aeronautical 
            Rocketry (<a href="https://starlabsurat.com/">STAR</a>), Surat, in September 2021. The aim of this project was to develop a Non-Pyrotechnic recovery system for high-powered
            model rockets.<br>
            A major goal in model rocketry is to safely retrieve a rocket after it has been launched. A Recovery system helps us in this achieving this. However, a pyrotechnic 
            recovery system is not practicable in high-powered rocketry as the explosive used cannot be tested. This results in an unreliable recovery system and a damaged rocket 
            making it a costly affair. Hence, a non-pyrotechnic recovery system is the need of the hour.<br>
            As a Systems Engineer of a team of 6, my responsibilities included coordinating the work of the Design team and Avionics team. I was also responsible for coming up with the 
            conceptual design and performing the modelling and animation of the system in Fusion 360.<br>
            Further details of the project can be found <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357555006_Internship_Report_on_HIGH-POWERED_ROCKET_USING_NON-PYRO_RECOVERY_SYSTEM_At_STAR_-Space_Technology_and_Aeronautical_Rocketry">here</a>!
