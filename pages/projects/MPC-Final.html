            <h1>Model Predictive Tracking Control of Unmanned Ground Vehicle</h1>
            <p>
                As a part of the final evaluation of the Model Predictive Control (MPC) course (Special study) offered at <a href="https://vt.edu">Virginia Tech</a> (VT), a control sequence
                was modelled for the trajectory tracking of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV). This project was conducted under the guidance of Dr. Kaveh Akbari Hamed from the Department 
                of Mechanical Engineering at VT.<br>
                The UGV in question was based on the Dynamic Bicycle Model of a ground vehicle. The goal of this project was for the UGV to successfully track two desired trajectories 
                using the MPC algorithm. Using the equations of motion and principles of MPC, an objective function with specific constraints were obtained. The optimization was performed 
                using the quadprog algorithm in MATLAB. The control horizon and optimization parameters were manually tuned for an Infinity-shaped trajectory and a Horseshoe-shaped trajectory.<br>
                All the computations and control algorithms were performed in MATLAB followed by the generation of an animation sequence for each of the 2 cases.
