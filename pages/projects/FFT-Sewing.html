            <h1>FFT Analysis of Vibration Signals from Traditional Sewing Machine</h1>
            <p>
                In this project a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Analysis of vibration signals from a Traditional Sewing Machine was conducted as part of the Condition Monitoring course
                offered by the Department of Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.coep.org.in/">COEP-Tech</a>. This project was conducted under the guidance of Dr. S. S. Mohite
                and Dr. P. P. Suryawanshi.<br>
                The goal of this mini-project was to understand how the vibration signals of a sewing machine vary under various conditions. The signals were analysed when the machine was 
                in a regularly operated and maintained, i.e., Good state. Moreover, the analysis was performed when the machine was in a state where it was not regularly maintained. Lastly, 
                some faults were deliberately introduced in the machine to analyse the faulty states. These included - loosening of the bobbin case, unbalancing the hand wheel, and 
                loosening the feed dog.<br>
                This short analysis was presented and evaluated during the course duration. urther details of the project can be found <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357554574_FFT_Analysis_of_Traditional_Sewing_Machine_Signal?_sg%5B0%5D=rrFYqLg8xrccP4A6rsHNyQ3zB2m1SPPNejtubxbHg9jZJNA3IVcCdETfr6W9A33aWPoQfZc32wuNrMlbmJk0WzKY87J6wYImWS8D7dx9.4_-LYFvi-BQ7ru-9p3ONDi1pO73xqt_72oACHGtdBZqrJPTSlukqVIfsdCKfmzsQMNtiRk6HoLRfDEdWHNl6CA&_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicGFnZSI6InByb2ZpbGUiLCJwb3NpdGlvbiI6InBhZ2VDb250ZW50In19">here</a>!
