            <h1>Static Test Pad for Rocket Motors</h1>
            <p>
                This project was conducted as a part of the Virtual Training and Internship Programme (VTIP-16) organized by Space Technology and Aeronautical 
                Rocketry (<a href="https://starlabsurat.com/">STAR</a>), Surat, in September 2021. The aim of this project was to develop a Static Test Pad (STP) for testing model 
                rocket motors.<br>
                STP is a test stand used for conducting full-scale static test fires of a solid rocket motors and engines of various sizes and types. It is performed to characterize 
                the thrust curves and specific impulse (I<sub>sp</sub>) of the motor. STPs help in understanding the characteristics of a rocket motor which in turn helps in saving the testing
                cost of the model rocket. The goal of this project was to design a unique STP that could be used for a variety of motor sizes and lengths while being lightweight, 
                small in size and cost effective.<br>
                As a Systems Engineer of a team of 6, my responsibilities included coordinating the work of the Design team and Avionics team. I was also responsible for coming up with the 
                conceptual design and performing the modelling and animation of the system in Fusion 360.<br>
                Further details of the project can be found <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357554998_Internship_Report_on_STATIC_TEST_PAD_FOR_ROCKET_MOTOR_At_STAR_-_Space_Technology_and_Aeronautical_Rocketry">here</a>!
