            <h1>Review of RoboBee: Harvard's insect-sized Biomimetic Robot</h1>
            <p>
                A brief overview of RoboBee - Harvard's insect-sized Biomimetic Robot, was conducted in this project as part of the Robotics and Automation elective
                offered by the Department of Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.coep.org.in/">COEP-Tech</a>. This project was conducted under the guidance of Dr. S. S. Ohol.<br>
                The goal of this project was to discuss the progress of RoboBee project over the course of years, starting from 2007. Various aspects of RoboBee have been discussed
                in this project, including - history, working principle, manufacturing process, control, and possible modifications. The project also summarised the numerous applications
                and limitations of RoboBee.<br>
                A comprehensive report and presentation of this project was carried out and evaluated during the course duration. Further details of the project can be found <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357554403_RoboBee_-_Harvard's_insect-sized_Biomimetic_Robot">here</a>!
