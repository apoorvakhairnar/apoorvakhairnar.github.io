            <h1>Study of "A Numerical Model for Design and Optimization of Surface Textures for Tilting Pad Thrust Bearings"</h1>
            <p>
                As part of the course Numerical Methods and Computer Programming (NMCP) offered by the Department of Mechanical Engineering at 
                <a href="https://www.coep.org.in/">COEP-Tech</a>, the article <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301679X17304899">A Numerical Model for 
                    Design and Optimization of Surface Textures for Tilting Pad Thrust Bearings</a> was 
                studied under the guidance of Dr. A. D. Patange. The focus of this study was to understand the applications of the numerical methods utilized in the article.<br>
                This article applied various numerical methods for optimizing the surface texturing parameters of tilting pad thrust bearings used in rotating shafts. The focal point 
                of this study was understanding the use of Newton-Raphson method from a practical application perspective. A video presentation of this project can be watched on
